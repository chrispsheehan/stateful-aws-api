# stateful-aws-api

Test AWS lambda locally while developing!


## local dev

### `just start`: local development environment

- the below runs a [local instance of dynamodb](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html), the api and a test instance.
- the app and test instance will automatically (live load) run on changes to any `.ts` files.

```sh
app-dev   | LOCAL app listening on http://localhost:9000
test-dev  | PASS __tests__/hello.test.ts
test-dev  |   /hello
test-dev  |     âœ“ is 200 (19 ms)
test-dev  | 
test-dev  | Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
